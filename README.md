At&amp;t code challenge
In this project I am finding out the maximum temperature recorded in "010990 99999 VARDO AP / SVARTNES" place in year 2017.I have implemented Map reduce programs to 
find the maximum temperature and used Apache Hadoop commons and Apache Hadoop Map reduce core libraries.The reason to go with Mapreduce is I am good
in programming using Java but while implemeting Spark I am good in programming Spark using Python.In this repository I have also shared my python code.
